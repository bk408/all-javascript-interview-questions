# find Reverse of a string without using built-in method

Built-in Method => split.reverse.join

without built-in method => for loop

we run the loop

let i = str.length -> 1 because we want reverse string so we need to move from end to start
i >= 0 :- i value should be 0 or less than 0 due to reverse situation
