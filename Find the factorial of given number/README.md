# Find the factorial of given number

1. Recursive Method: 🔄➡️ In the recursive method, n \* factorial(n - 1) calls the factorial function repeatedly, reducing n by 1 each time, until n reaches 0. This captures the full factorial calculation, which is defined as the product of all positive integers up to n.

Recursive Method:

Pros:

✨ Intuitive: Recursion can be more intuitive and closer to the mathematical definition of factorial.
📝 Simpler Code: The code can be shorter and easier to understand for those familiar with recursion.

Cons:

⚠️ Stack Overflow Risk: For large values of n, recursion can lead to stack overflow errors because each function call uses stack space.
⏳ Performance: Recursion can be less efficient due to the overhead of repeated function calls and maintaining the call stack.

Iterative Method:

Pros:

🧠 Memory Efficient: Iteration uses a fixed amount of memory (constant space complexity, O(1)), as it doesn't have the overhead of maintaining a call stack.
🚀 Performance: Generally faster for large inputs because there is no function call overhead.
✅ No Stack Overflow: It can handle larger values of n without the risk of stack overflow.

Cons:

🖊️ Verbose Code: The code might be slightly more verbose compared to the recursive version.
🤔 Less Intuitive: For those who think in terms of recursion, iterative solutions might be less intuitive.
