Write a function that returns the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms.


1. Recursion method


2. for loop 


Fibonacci sequence is the integer sequence where the first two terms are 0 and 1. After that, the next term is defined as the sum of the previous two terms. 

f(n) = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2)

ex - 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
